### Hi there 👋
I'm Elizaveta Tymofieieva, a passionate front-end developer, сompleted RSScool courses for front-end developers.     
I like dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take care of the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.        
I'm currently looking for new opportunities.
